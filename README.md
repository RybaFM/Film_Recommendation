# Introduction
In this project I will be analysing peoples preferences in films and then making recommendations for new users based on other users preferences.
# Background
I recently started playing with machine learning and especially with Scikit-learn. I was really looking forward to apply my new skills in machine-learning and to become on first-name terms with KNN-model. I decided to make user-based KNN-model that will analyse already existing users preferences and after that will be making recommendations for new users in system.
## In this project I will be aiming to:
- find out what are most popular films among users
- then I will break down data into male and female groups and analyse trends differences between genders
- then I will go further and break down existing groups into age subgroups and analyse how trends differ between different age groups
- then I will give to a KNN-model data and we will look how accurately it will be recommending films to certain people based on their preferences in genres.
# Tools I used
- **Python** - main programming language
- **NumPy** - numerical operations
- **Pandas** - data manipulations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** - making recommendations 
# The Analysis
Analysis is divided into two parts. First part will be dedicated to analysis of data itself, data has a lot of biases and stereotypes based on age and gender though, but it was meant to make those two parameters play a role in recommendations. In the second part I will analyze how accurately my model is making recommendations.
